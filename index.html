    <h2>💛 Just a Little Note for You</h2>

    <p>Heyyy Payal,</p>
    <p>I owe you a heartfelt "I'm sorry" — and not the rushed kind, but the kind that sits with you, that means I really care.</p>

    <p>Okay, I messed up. Big oops. Called you by the wrong name but it was never about forgetting you.</p>
    <p> How could I? You’re the one I laugh with, late night walks/talks, and secretly smile about long after we part.</p>
    <!-- <p>I hope this message finds you, even if it's in a moment of uncertainty. I've spent a lot of time reflecting on
      us, on our journey together, and the gravity of my actions. I want to sincerely apologize for any pain I may have
      caused you.</p> -->

    <!-- <p>Our journey, marked by countless shared moments and memories, holds a special place in my heart. From the
      laughter that echoed through the years to the quiet moments that spoke volumes, each step we took together was a
      testament to the love I feel for you.</p> -->

    <!-- <p>I want you to know that my love for you has always been unwavering. In the midst of challenges and
      misunderstandings, it remains a constant force in my life. I cherish the unique bond we share, and the thought of
      losing that connection is something I cannot bear.</p> -->

    <!-- <p>I recognize and take full responsibility for the mistakes I've made. They were never a reflection of my feelings
      for you but rather a lapse in judgment. I'm committed to learning from these errors and doing the necessary work
      to rebuild the trust that may have been shaken.</p> -->

    <!-- <p>As I express these sentiments, I want you to feel the depth of my remorse and the sincerity of my love. You are
      an integral part of my life, and the thought of causing you pain is a heavy burden that I carry. I am truly sorry.
    </p> -->
    <p>This little page is here because I miss you — your sarcasm, your eye-rolls, even your "I'm ignoring you" energy (okay, maybe not that last part 😅).</p>

    <p>So here it is: </p>
     <p> 💌 I'm sorry.</p>
     <p> 💌 You matter more than I can fit in a paragraph.</p> 
     <p>💌 And if you give me the chance, I’ll spend more time proving that — with the right name, the right words, and the right kind of admiration.</p>

    <p>I hope this made you smile a little.
    </p>
    <!-- <p>I care about you deeply. I admire who you are — and I miss the way we talk, laugh, and just exist in our little world.</p> -->

    <p>So… when you're ready to talk again, I’ll be here. Probably checking my phone like a lovesick idiot. 💬❤️
    </p> 
     <p>Yours (the one who totally knows your name, promise 🫴🏼),</p>

    <p>Aati Aagav</p>
